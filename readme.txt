A Geo-Coding Plugin that enables to tag Posts and Pages with Geo-Coordinates.


== Description ==

Using this plugin you can place posts and pages on a Google map. The Geo-Position will be determined from an address.
The Google map can be embedded to a post or page with one of two shortcodes that accept parameters controlling the display properties of the map and the behaviour of the links.
So, you can show in a very simple way where you gathered some information, took a photograph or where an event will happen.

- The current version uses an own SQL table to store and retrieve the Geo-Data.
- The global settings can be modified on an own dashboard page in the WordPress backend.
- The Plugin ships a backend widget for entering the data on a post or page which can even be edited on the Quick-Edit screen.
- There are two shortcodes (1) to embed a large map with all posts/pages as markers and (2) a mini-map with the current one as marker.


Planned Features:
- Manage locations as a Custom Post Type to reuse several Geo-Data more than ones in a blog.
- Put posts and pages an predefined routes.
- Further features may be requested on the Plugin page.
