A GeoCoding Plugin that enables to tag Posts and Pages with GeoCoordinates.


== Description ==

Using this plugin you can place posts and pages on a google map. The GeoPosition will be determined from an address. The map can be embedded to a post or page with one of two shortcodes that accept parameters controlling the display properties of the map and the behaviour of the links. So you can show in a very simple way where you gathered some informations, took a photograph or where an event will happen.

- The current version uses an own sql-table to store and retrieve the GeoData.
- The global settings can be set on an own dashboard page.
- The plugin ships a dashboard widget for entering the data on a post or page which can as well be edited on the QuickEdit screen.
- There are two shorcodes (1) to embed a large with all posts/pages as markers and (2) a small map with the current one as marker.

Planned Features:
- inidividual choice of pin color per post/page
- Drag 'n drop of pins on the dashboard widget.
- Further features may be requested on the plugin page.
